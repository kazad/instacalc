[InstaCalc](https://instacalc.com) is the fast, easy, shareable online calculator. And it's surprisingly fun.

Here's a tour of the major features:

## Instant results

Results appear as you type -- there's no waiting. Most spreadsheets force you to confirm the result before seeing the answer (=300 * 400, Enter)

## Multiple results

See your work as you go -- the question, and the answer, side by side. If something looks off, you can edit it immediately. The goal is to be like working on paper.

## Readable numbers and equations

Use natural language that makes sense for you, not the comptuer:

* `6.6 billion` (or `6.6b`), not `6600000000`
* `distance = 50 mph * 3 hours`, not `=E3 * C2`

Reference results by name or row number (`r1`, `r2`).

The typical spreadsheet replies:

Hey, I can do that! You want commas? Just select cell > Format Menu > Cells... > Category Number > Comma Formatting > Click OK. If you want a friendly name instead of E3, just choose Insert > Name > Define...

Meanwhile, you've forgotten what you wanted to do in the first place. InstaCalc gets out of the way.

## Share any result

You can save a public link to any calculation with 1 click (no login!). Post the link on a forum, blog, or social media -- and your readers can play with their own numbers. no logins, no attachments, no fuss. Readers can see your thoughts, change the numbers, and comment back with a new link!

The best part is your original link stays the same. If someone changes the numbers, they get a new, custom link to share.

## Put a calculator on your website

Even better than linking, show off your thoughts! Click the Embed button to get a shortcode to put InstaCalc on your site, like this:

Calculations are as shareable as a YouTube video. Again, readers can edit the results, no login required.

## Dozens of power features

InstaCalc is filled with powerful features you wouldn't expect from a calculator:

* Unit, date/time, timezone, currency conversions
* Programming, if/else, hex/binary/decimal
* Scientific/exponentia/engineering
* Many output display formats

The best part? If you never use 'em, the features aren't in your face. See the reference section for a full list.

## Make programming easier

Software geeks (myself included) appreciate an easy way to convert numbers to and from hex and binary. Use shortcuts like 1GB (yes, an actual GB). Use binary operations like AND, OR, NOT and XOR. Use simple if-then statements. And keep track of all your results at once.

## Use random numbers

Want to roll dice? Introduce random inputs into your formula? Practice your times tables? It's possible - just add random numbers to your equation.

## Hide rows you don't want.

Spreadsheets are nice because they hide details. InstaCalc can do the same: Just click a result to hide details for that row. Show the final results for a calculation, for a clean look.

## Take it for a test drive.

InstaCalc was meant to be fast and fun. Nope, you won't be throwing out your spreadsheet; 18-wheelers have their uses. But for everyday use, a sports car is more enjoyable. And a free sports car is even better.
