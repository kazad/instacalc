# Quickstart

[InstaCalc](https://instacalc.com) is a smart, powerful calculator that's surprinsgly fun to use.

Here's a tour of the major features.

## Instant results

Results appear as you type -- no waiting. Most spreadsheets force you to confirm a result before seeing the answer. `=300 * 400` then *Enter*.

## Multiple rows

See your formula and result side-by-side. If something's wrong, edit it immediately. The goal is like working on paper.

## Readable numbers and equations

Write numbers just as you would by hand:

* Use `6.6 billion` (or `6.6b`), not `6600000000`
* Write `distance = 50 mph x 3 hours`, not `=E3 * C2`

You can reference any result by row number (`r1`) or by name (`distance`).

Friendly numbers and named cells are possible in spreadsheets, but not easy.

## Share any result

Save a permalink to any calculation with 1 click (no login). Post the link on a forum, blog, or social media for readers to play with their own numbers.

## Put a calculator on your website

Even better than linking, show off your thoughts! Click the Embed button to get a shortcode to put InstaCalc on your site, like this:

Calculations are as shareable as a YouTube video. Again, readers can edit the results, no login required.

## Dozens of power features

InstaCalc is filled with powerful features you wouldn't expect from a calculator:

* Unit, date/time, timezone, currency conversions
* Programming, if/else, hex/binary/decimal
* Scientific/engineering functions
* Many output display formats

The best part? If you never use 'em, the features aren't in your face. See the [reference](/reference.html) for a full list.

## Make programming easier

Software geeks (myself included) appreciate an easy way to convert numbers to and from hex and binary. Use shortcuts like 1GB (yes, an actual GB). Use binary operations like AND, OR, NOT and XOR. Use simple if-then statements. And keep track of all your results at once.

## Hide rows you don't want.

Spreadsheets are nice because they hide details. InstaCalc can do the same: Just click a result to hide details for that row. Show the final results for a calculation, for a clean look.

## Take it for a test drive.

InstaCalc was meant to be fast and fun. You won't be throwing out your spreadsheet, just saving it for the most boring work. For everyday needs, instacalc is way more fun. Enjoy.
