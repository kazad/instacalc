Instacalc works with most SI units, and you can do comparison as seen above.
* Units can be used on their own (`cm` is treated as `1 cm`, so you can do `15 * cm`)
* Convert to SI base units with `to SI`
* Use dots or multiplication to make compound units: `15 kg*m/s^2`
* You can use `per` and other keywords for division and conversions: `15 miles/hour in meters per year`
