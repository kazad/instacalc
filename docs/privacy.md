## Analytics

InstaCalc does not collect or share data with 3rd parties for commercial purposes. However, analytics (Microsoft Clarity, Google Analytics, StatCounter, etc.) are used for performance and debugging purposes. This data is not shared.

## Calc Data

* By default, calcs are stored in the browser's Local Storage. No login needed. Calc data is stored in plaintext, though connections to instacalc.com are SSL encrypted.
* If you log in with Google/Apple, your calcs and preferences are synced to Google Firebase. This lets you sync calcs between a computer, phone, tablet, etc.
* You can [export](https://github.com/kazad/instacalc/discussions/98) your calcs to a JSON data file.

## Sharing and Search

* When a calc is published, a copy goes to a read-only URL like `https://instacalc.com/123`. As you update your original calc, this URL updates. Other users can browse and make test changes at the public link, but it doesn't change the original.
* Calcs are not indexed for search by default. If you post a link or embed code publicly (blog, reddit, twitter), then Google may crawl it. The instacalc.com search will surface calcs that appear in Google's index (similar to a Google site search like ` site:instacalc.com keyword`).
* To unpublish a calc, click the "unshare" button. This erases the shared calc, but keeps the original.
