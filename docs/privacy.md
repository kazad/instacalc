## Analytics

InstaCalc does not collect or share data with 3rd parties for commercial purposes. However, analytics (Microsoft Clarity, Google Analytics, StatCounter, etc.) are used for performance and debugging purposes. This data is not shared.

## Calc Data

* By default, calcs are stored in the browser's Local Storage. No login needed.

* If you log in with Google/Apple, your calcs and preferences are synced to Google Firebase. This lets you sync calcs between a computer, phone, tablet, etc.

* When calcs are shared publicly, they are published to a read-only URL like `https://instacalc.com/123`. As you update your calc, this URL live updates. Users can make test changes at that URL, but it doesn't change the original calc.
