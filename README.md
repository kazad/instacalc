Goal: A fast, easy, shareable online calculator. 

* Fast: Results appear instantly as you type.
* Easy: Use natural language where possible (`50k + 3,500`). Allow plain-english operations (`15 squared`). Let people interact naturally.
* Shareable: Get a public link to your calc with 1 click. No login.
